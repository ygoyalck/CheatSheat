Enter a number and press enter, enter is still in buffer
getline function terminates on enter,it will not work if it encounters an enter 
So just after inputting any enter, use cin.ignore() to use getline()




Conclusion: After every enter(not after getline because it is terminating for it) use cin.ignore() for using cin.getline() again
