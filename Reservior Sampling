Problem:
Choose k entries from n numbers. Make sure each number is selected with the probability of k/n
Basic idea:
Choose 1, 2, 3, ..., k first and put them into the reservoir.
For k+1, pick it with a probability of k/(k+1), and randomly replace a number in the reservoir.
For k+i, pick it with a probability of k/(k+i), and randomly replace a number in the reservoir.
Repeat until k+i reaches n
